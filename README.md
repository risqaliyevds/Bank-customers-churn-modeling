### Introduction:
In this notebook, I will be working on a customer churning model. The goal of this project is to predict which customers are likely to churn and why they are doing so. Customer churn is a common problem in many industries, including telecommunications, banking, and e-commerce. It is important to identify customers who are at risk of churning and take appropriate actions to retain them.

To accomplish this goal, I will be using machine learning techniques to build a predictive model. I will start by gathering and exploring data on customer demographics, transaction history, customer support interactions, and any other relevant information. Then, I will preprocess the data to prepare it for modeling, which may involve cleaning, feature engineering, and scaling.

Next, I will train and evaluate several machine learning models to predict customer churn. I will use a variety of metrics to evaluate model performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Based on these metrics, I will select the best-performing model and fine-tune it to improve its accuracy.

Finally, I will interpret the model results and draw insights from them. I will identify the key features that contribute most to customer churn and make recommendations to the business on how to address these issues.

By the end of this notebook, I hope to have built a robust customer churning model that can help businesses retain their customers and improve their bottom line.
